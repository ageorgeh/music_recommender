This app is a proof of concept for a music recommender. 
It allows you to search for an artist and/or track using the Spotify search API.
Then it will find recommendations based on this using the Spotify recommendation API.
These are then displayed with a preview of the song if it is available. 

Additions such as multiple artists, tracks, genres along with instumentation, danceability etc can be added to fine tune the recommendations
